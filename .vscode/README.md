# VS Code Settings

## VS Code Minimalist Configuration

This `settings.json` file is designed to create a clean, distraction-free coding
environment for developers, educators, or learners who prefer simplicity and
focus. It disables many of VS Codeâ€™s default features that might feel
overwhelming or unnecessary, allowing you to concentrate on the code itself.
